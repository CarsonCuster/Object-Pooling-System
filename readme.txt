Owen Engle and Carson Custer

How to set up object pooler:
Create player GameObject, attach "inputManager" script, which will automatically attach "Movement" script
Also attach "WeaponManager" script to player
Attach the "Bullet" script to the Bulletprefab
Create an empty GameObject and attach the "BulletPooler" script
	In the inspector, drop in a prefab for a bullet* in "Bulletprefab", set the initial size of the pool under "Pool Size", and toggle 		whether or not the size of the pool can increase during use using the "Can Grow" box

*Bullet prefab must be a gameObject with a rigidBody2D


Collaboration:

Collaboration between Owen and I went very well. We were able to set a day to begin working on the assignment, and both stay focused for the entirety of working. We both brought different strengths to the table. I scheduled the meeting time and situated who would be working on what. Owen was very knowledgeable when it came to creating functioning scripts for the assignment, along with helping me with a few problems I had while working. The collaboration went very well all in all.
